# Mnemo Plugin for Claude Code

Persistent memory system that gives Claude Code long-term recall across sessions.

- **Session start**: Automatically loads your memories
- **Session end**: Prompts to save decisions, issues, and conventions
- **Context compression**: Saves continuity notes so nothing is lost
- **Plan accepted**: Saves accepted plans as decision records

## Setup (macOS)

Copy and paste each step into Terminal. Wait for each step to finish before moving to the next.

### 1. Install Xcode Command Line Tools

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

A popup will appear — click **Install** and wait for it to finish. If it says "already installed", move on.

### 2. Install Homebrew

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Follow any prompts. If it says Homebrew is already installed, move on.

> **Important:** After install, Homebrew may tell you to run two commands to add it to your PATH. Copy and run those commands before continuing.

### 3. Install Node.js

```bash
brew install node
```

Verify:
```bash
node --version
```
Should show v22 or higher (anything 18+ is fine).

### 4. Install Claude Code

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Launch and sign in with your Anthropic account:
```bash
claude
```

Once signed in, type `/exit` to close.

### 5. Install the Mnemo plugin

Launch Claude Code:
```bash
claude
```

Run these two commands inside Claude Code:
```
/plugin marketplace add RICO-Technologies-LLC/mnemo-plugin
/plugin install mnemo@mnemo-plugin
```

Type `/exit` to close.

### 6. Set up your account

Launch Claude Code:
```bash
claude
```

Claude will detect that MMRY AI is installed but not configured, and walk you through setup automatically. It will ask whether you're creating a new organization or joining an existing one, collect your details, and handle the rest.

If the automatic prompt doesn't appear, type `/mnemo:setup` to start manually.

### 7. Restart Claude Code

Type `/exit`, then:
```bash
claude
```

Done! MMRY AI is active. On your first session, Claude will help you create your initial memories. Type `/mnemo:help` anytime for a quick reference.

## Setup (Windows)

### 1. Install Node.js

Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version). Run the installer with default settings.

### 2. Install Git for Windows

Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win). Run the installer with default settings. This provides Git Bash, which the plugin requires.

### 3. Install Claude Code

Open a terminal and run:
```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Then follow Steps 4–7 from the macOS instructions above.

## Setup (Existing Claude Code Users)

If you already have Claude Code installed:

```
/plugin marketplace add RICO-Technologies-LLC/mnemo-plugin
/plugin install mnemo@mnemo-plugin
```

Restart Claude Code. Claude will guide you through setup automatically. Restart again after setup completes. Done.

## Auto-Updates

When installed from the GitHub marketplace, the plugin updates automatically whenever a new version is pushed. No action needed.
