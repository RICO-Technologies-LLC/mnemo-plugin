# Mnemo Help

Mnemo is your memory. It remembers your decisions, conventions, preferences, and context across every session — so you never have to repeat yourself.

## How It Works

You don't need to do anything special. Mnemo runs quietly in the background:

- **When a session starts**, your memories load automatically. Claude already knows your context.
- **When a session ends**, Claude is prompted to save anything important before closing.
- **When context gets compressed**, Claude saves a continuity note so nothing is lost.
- **When a plan is accepted**, Claude saves it as a decision record.

## Things You Can Say

You can talk to Claude naturally about your memories:

- **"Remember this: we always use kebab-case for file names."** — Claude saves it as a memory.
- **"Save a Foundation memory about our tech stack."** — Foundation memories never expire. Use them for things that define who you are.
- **"What do you remember about our deployment process?"** — Claude searches your memories.
- **"Forget the memory about the old API endpoint."** — Claude deactivates it.
- **"Load my memories."** — Reloads your memories mid-session (same as `/mnemo:load-memories`).

## Memory Types

Not all memories are equal. Use the right type for the right purpose:

| Type | Lasts | Good For |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Foundation** | Forever | Who you are, your values, your stack, your conventions |
| **Strategic** | 1 year | Architecture decisions, communication patterns, long-term plans |
| **Operational** | 3 months | Active project knowledge, current workflows |
| **Tactical** | 7 days | This week's tasks, current sprint context |
| **Momentary** | 8 hours | Right now — what you're working on this session |

Memories that get accessed regularly stay alive longer. Memories that stop being relevant fade naturally.

## Tips

- **You don't need to memorize this.** Just talk to Claude. Say "remember this" or "save this as a decision" and Claude handles the rest.
- **Foundation memories are your identity.** Take a few minutes early on to tell Claude about your team, your tools, and your values. Everything builds on that.
- **Don't over-save.** Only save things you'd want to know next week or next month. Claude's own context handles the rest within a session.
- **Memories are private to your organization.** Your team shares memories. Other organizations can't see them.
