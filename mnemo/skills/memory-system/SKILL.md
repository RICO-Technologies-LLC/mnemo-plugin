# Claude Memory System

## Overview
You have access to a persistent memory store via the Mnemo REST API. Use it to maintain context across sessions.

**Do NOT use PowerShell — all operations use bash.** The plugin includes pre-built bash scripts for all memory operations. For custom queries, source `mnemo-client.sh` directly.

**Automated lifecycle:** The Mnemo plugin handles these events automatically via hooks:
- **Session start** — Memories are loaded automatically (Foundation + universals + directory-matched)
- **Session end** — You'll be prompted to save any decisions, issues, or notes before exiting
- **Context compression** — You'll be prompted to save a Momentary "Session Continuity" memory before compression
- **Plan accepted** — You'll be prompted to save accepted plans as Decision memories

This skill covers everything else: how to store memories, query mid-session, search, link, and manage the memory system.

## How to Execute Memory Operations

### Pre-Built Scripts (preferred)

The plugin includes pre-built bash scripts for common memory operations. Each is a single command:

| Script | Operation |
|--------|-----------|
| `save-memory.sh` | Store a new memory |
| `reinforce-memory.sh` | Reinforce (reset expiration) |
| `deactivate-memory.sh` | Deactivate a memory |
| `link-memories.sh` | Link two memories |
| `search-memories.sh` | Search memories by keyword |
| `list-groups.sh` | List your permission groups |

All scripts are in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks-handlers/`. See the relevant sections below for usage examples.

**Run in background** when you don't need the result immediately — memory saves, reinforcements, deactivations, and links rarely need to block the conversation. Use `run_in_background: true` on the Bash tool call so the script executes without blocking.

### Custom Queries (source the client library)

For operations that need custom handling, source `mnemo-client.sh` and call API wrapper functions directly:

```bash
source "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks-handlers/mnemo-client.sh"

# Call any API function
mnemo_search_memories "authentication" "backend"
echo "$MNEMO_RESPONSE"

# Get related memories
mnemo_get_related 42
echo "$MNEMO_RESPONSE"

# Get active sessions
mnemo_get_active_sessions
echo "$MNEMO_RESPONSE"
```

Available functions: `mnemo_create_memory`, `mnemo_get_memories`, `mnemo_get_startup_memories`, `mnemo_get_memory_by_id`, `mnemo_search_memories`, `mnemo_deactivate_memory`, `mnemo_reinforce_memory`, `mnemo_create_link`, `mnemo_delete_link`, `mnemo_get_related`, `mnemo_register_session`, `mnemo_get_active_sessions`, `mnemo_get_my_groups`, `mnemo_health`.

After each call, check `$MNEMO_HTTP_CODE` and `$MNEMO_RESPONSE` for the result.

## API Endpoints

All operations go through the Mnemo REST API:

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/memories` | Store a memory (409 on duplicate topic+scope) |
| GET | `/api/memories` | Retrieve memories (auto-reinforces) |
| GET | `/api/memories/search?q=` | Keyword search |
| GET | `/api/memories/startup` | Get startup memories (Foundation + dir-matched) |
| GET | `/api/memories/{id}` | Get single memory by ID |
| DELETE | `/api/memories/{id}` | Deactivate a memory |
| POST | `/api/memories/{id}/reinforce` | Reinforce (reset expiration) |
| POST | `/api/memories/{id}/links` | Create memory link |
| DELETE | `/api/memories/{id}/links/{targetId}` | Delete memory link |
| GET | `/api/memories/{id}/related` | Get related memories |
| POST | `/api/sessions` | Register/update session |
| GET | `/api/sessions/active` | List active sessions |
| GET | `/api/groups/mine` | List your permission groups |

## Mid-Session Loading

Memories are auto-loaded at session start (Foundation + universals + directory-matched). To reload mid-session, use the `/mnemo:load-memories` command, or source the client library:

```bash
source "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks-handlers/mnemo-client.sh"
mnemo_get_memories "$PWD" "" "" "" ""
echo "$MNEMO_RESPONSE"
```

### Tier Expiration

The API automatically filters out stale memories based on tier:
- **Foundation** — always loaded (core facts, never expire)
- **Strategic** — loaded if less than 1 year old (priorities, direction)
- **Operational** — loaded if less than 3 months old (working knowledge)
- **Tactical** — loaded if less than 7 days old (current task context)
- **Momentary** — loaded if less than 8 hours old (immediate/in-progress items)

For Operational, Tactical, and Momentary tiers, the expiration clock resets each time a memory is reinforced (see Reinforcement below). A memory accessed yesterday has a fresh clock, regardless of when it was originally created.

## How to Store Memories

Use the pre-built `save-memory.sh` script:

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks-handlers/save-memory.sh" \
  --tier "Operational" \
  --category "Decision" \
  --scope "backend" \
  --topic "Refund Handling" \
  --content "DECISION: Use API to refund directly when the platform fails to save transaction ID." \
  --source "claude" \
  --task-id "TSK-4521" \
  --working-dir "$PWD" \
  --session-id "$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID"
```

Optional parameters (`--task-id`, `--project-id`, `--visibility`, `--permission-group-id`, `--supersedes`) can be omitted — they default to empty/NULL. **Always include `--session-id "$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID"`.** `--working-dir` is optional — if omitted, it defaults to the session launch directory (persisted at session start). Returns `NewMemoryID` on success.

## When to Store a Memory
Store a memory when any of the following happen:
- A **decision** is made about architecture, process, or approach
- A **bug** is resolved — store root cause and fix
- A **new pattern or convention** is established
- A team member says "remember this", "note this", "going forward", "don't forget" or "the standard is"
- A **new integration, client, or project** is introduced
- Something **didn't work** and should be avoided in the future
- A **plan is accepted** — the PostToolUse hook will prompt you, but you can also store plans proactively

## How to Write Good Memory Content
Write short, declarative statements. Like briefing a new team member.

**Good:**
```
DECISION: App V2.0 uses UPC as primary product identifier. SKU is fallback only.
REASON: Sync failures with distributor catalog when using SKU.
```

**Bad:**
```
We had a long discussion about identifiers and after considering several options we decided UPC was the best choice for various reasons.
```

## Reinforcement

Memories in Operational, Tactical, and Momentary tiers are automatically reinforced when retrieved via the GET memories endpoint. Reinforcement increments the access count and resets the expiration clock — a reinforced memory persists as if it were just created.

**Automatic:** Every call to GET /api/memories reinforces the Operational, Tactical, and Momentary memories it returns. No manual action needed — memories that keep being loaded stay alive. Memories that stop being loaded (wrong directory, out of scope) naturally expire.

**Manual:** You can still reinforce a specific memory explicitly if needed:

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks-handlers/reinforce-memory.sh" 42
```

Foundation and Strategic memories are excluded from reinforcement. Foundation never expires. Strategic should be consciously re-evaluated at year end, not silently extended.

## Associative Linking

Memories can be linked to each other to form associative networks. Links are separate from the memory data itself — they represent relationships between memories.

### Link Types

| Type | Directionality | Meaning |
|------|---------------|---------|
| `related` | Symmetric | Same topic area |
| `supersedes` | Directional | Source replaces target |
| `elaborates` | Directional | Source adds detail to target |
| `contradicts` | Symmetric | Conflict, flag for human review |

### Creating Links

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks-handlers/link-memories.sh" 42 87 "related"
```

For symmetric types (`related`, `contradicts`), the API normalizes order automatically — you don't need to worry about which ID goes first.

### Retrieving Related Memories

```bash
source "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks-handlers/mnemo-client.sh"
mnemo_get_related 42
echo "$MNEMO_RESPONSE"
```

Returns all linked memories in both directions (outgoing and incoming), with `linkType` and `linkDirection` fields. Only returns active memories.

This is a deliberate call — related memories are NOT automatically loaded at startup. Use it when you want to explore connections.

### Removing Links

```bash
source "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks-handlers/mnemo-client.sh"
mnemo_delete_link 42 87
```

### When to Link

- **Link at storage time** when the relationship is obvious (e.g., a new decision that supersedes an old one)
- **Link during discovery** when you realize two loaded memories are related
- **Do not bulk-link** retrospectively — links should reflect genuine associations, not retroactive organization

### Supersedes Pattern

When a decision changes, store the new memory and link it as `supersedes`:
```bash
# Store updated decision — returns NewMemoryID (e.g., 95)
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks-handlers/save-memory.sh" \
  --tier "Operational" --category "Decision" --scope "backend" \
  --topic "Primary Product ID" \
  --content "DECISION: Use UPC as primary. SKU as fallback. EAN for EU markets." \
  --source "eric" --working-dir "$PWD" --session-id "$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID"

# Link to the old decision it replaces
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks-handlers/link-memories.sh" 95 42 "supersedes"
```

Or use the `--supersedes` flag to do both in one step:
```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks-handlers/save-memory.sh" \
  --tier "Operational" --category "Decision" --scope "backend" \
  --topic "Primary Product ID" \
  --content "DECISION: Use UPC as primary. SKU as fallback. EAN for EU markets." \
  --source "eric" --supersedes 42 --working-dir "$PWD" --session-id "$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID"
```

## Search

Search finds memories by keyword across Topic and Content fields, regardless of age. This is intentional — search is how you recover memories that have expired from normal loading.

```bash
# Search all scopes
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks-handlers/search-memories.sh" "UPC"

# Search within a specific scope
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks-handlers/search-memories.sh" "refund" "backend"
```

### When to Search

- When encountering an unexpected topic that feels familiar
- When doing cross-scope work and you suspect related knowledge exists
- When a keyword keeps coming up and you want to check if there's institutional knowledge about it
- When you need older context that may have aged out of normal loading

### Search + Reinforce Pattern

Search recovers expired memories. Reinforcement revives them. Together they mirror how the brain recalls from long-term storage through associative pathways:

```bash
# Search finds an expired Operational memory (ID 42, last accessed 4 months ago)
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks-handlers/search-memories.sh" "UPC"

# You use the memory's content to guide your work → reinforce it
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks-handlers/reinforce-memory.sh" 42
# Memory is now alive again in normal loading results (clock reset)
```

## Memory Tier Hierarchy

Memory tiers follow four considerations, in order of importance:

| Priority | Consideration | Tier | What Goes Here |
|----------|--------------|------|----------------|
| 1 | **Values & Identity** | Foundation | Core values AND identity & orientation. Initialization memories (team, key systems) load first as the boot sequence. |
| 2 | **Organization** | Strategic | How work is structured — conventions, lifecycle, processes |
| 3 | **Communication** | Strategic | How the team communicates — templates, formats, standards |
| 4 | **Skill** | Operational | Practice areas, tools, platforms, workflows, working knowledge |

**Foundation is sacred.** Only core values and Initialization memories (identity & orientation) belong at Foundation tier. Initialization memories use the `Initialization` category and are automatically sorted first in query results — they form the boot sequence that orients every new session.

### All Tiers

| Tier | Use For | Expiration | Reinforceable |
|------|---------|------------|---------------|
| Foundation | Core values and Initialization (identity & orientation) | Never | No |
| Strategic | Organization & communication standards | 1 year from creation | No |
| Operational | Active working knowledge | 3 months from last access | Yes |
| Tactical | This week's work | 7 days from last access | Yes |
| Momentary | Right now | 8 hours from last access | Yes |

### Balance Principle

Store enough that any Claude session can do a great job working with the team. Don't waste space, and don't under-share. Store decision-guiding knowledge and file pointers — not full document content that already exists on disk.

## Working Directory

`--working-dir` is optional. If omitted, `save-memory.sh` reads the session launch directory from `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/mnemo-session-dir` (written by `session-start.sh` at session startup). This ensures the recorded directory is always the project root where Claude Code was launched, not a transient subdirectory or worktree. Falls back to `$PWD` if the session dir file doesn't exist.

The API records the working directory for directory-scoped loading and traceability. Universal memories (Foundation, Strategic, most Operational) load everywhere regardless of working directory — recording it simply tells future sessions where the memory was created.

**Examples:**
```bash
# Tactical memory — working dir used for scoped loading
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks-handlers/save-memory.sh" \
  --tier "Tactical" --category "Fact" --scope "backend" \
  --topic "Session Progress" \
  --content "Next up: test refund flow on staging" \
  --source "claude" --working-dir "$PWD" --session-id "$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID"

# Operational memory — working dir recorded for traceability, loads everywhere
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks-handlers/save-memory.sh" \
  --tier "Operational" --category "Decision" --scope "backend" \
  --topic "Primary Product ID" \
  --content "DECISION: Use UPC as primary product identifier. SKU is fallback only." \
  --source "eric" --working-dir "$PWD" --session-id "$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID"
```

## Project ID

The `--project-id` parameter tags a memory with an Intervals Project ID (integer), identifying what project the work relates to. Unlike working directory, project ID groups work logically — multiple directories can belong to one project.

- **Omitted** (default) — not project-scoped, loads in every session
- **An integer value** — only loads when the caller passes matching project ID

**When to set --project-id:**
- Tactical and Momentary memories tied to a specific Intervals project

**Leave it omitted when:**
- The memory applies across projects (most memories)
- You don't know the Intervals Project ID

## Session ID

**Always pass `--session-id "$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID"` when saving memories.** This provides traceability from any memory back to the conversation that created it. The value is available in the `$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` environment variable.

## Session Coordination

When multiple Claude sessions may work on the same project, use the session registration API to register your presence. Other sessions loading memories for the same project/directory will see your registration and can avoid collisions.

Sessions are automatically registered at session start. The 8-hour auto-expiry handles stale registrations naturally.

## Categories
- **Initialization** — boot-sequence identity and orientation (Foundation tier only, sorted first)
- **Decision** — a choice that was made
- **Fact** — something that is true
- **Convention** — a standard or pattern to follow
- **Issue** — a known problem or limitation

## Scopes
Use consistent, lowercase scope names for your organization's platforms and projects. Examples: `global`, `frontend`, `backend`, `infrastructure`, `marketing`

## Task Linkage
The memory store is for **institutional knowledge** — decisions, patterns, lessons learned. The task management system is the source of truth for **what work is being done**.

When a memory originates from a specific task, include the `--task-id` parameter to link back to it. This is optional and should be omitted for memories that aren't tied to a specific task.

**Use --task-id when:**
- A lesson was learned while working a specific task
- A decision was made in the context of a task
- An issue was discovered during task work

**Leave it omitted when:**
- The memory is a general convention or standard
- It's a Foundation-tier fact about the product or team
- It applies broadly and didn't come from a specific task

**Examples:**
```bash
# Linked to a task: lesson learned during specific work
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks-handlers/save-memory.sh" \
  --tier "Operational" --category "Issue" --scope "backend" \
  --topic "Missing Transaction IDs" \
  --content "ISSUE: Platform occasionally fails to save transaction IDs on orders. IMPACT: Blocks automatic refunds. WORKAROUND: Refund via API directly." \
  --source "joel" --task-id "TSK-4521" \
  --working-dir "$PWD" --session-id "$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID"

# No task link: general convention (omit --task-id)
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks-handlers/save-memory.sh" \
  --tier "Foundation" --category "Convention" --scope "global" \
  --topic "SQL Security Pattern" \
  --content "CONVENTION: Use ownership chaining with stored procedures. No direct table access for service accounts." \
  --source "eric" --working-dir "$PWD" --session-id "$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID"
```

**Do not duplicate task details into memories.** The task system already tracks status, assignments, and timelines. Memories should capture the *knowledge gained* from doing the work, not the work itself.

## Group Visibility

Memories default to **Global** visibility (all users in the subscriber see them). You can also save **Private** (only the creator sees it) or **Group** (only members of a specific permission group see it).

### Listing Your Groups

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks-handlers/list-groups.sh"
```

This calls `GET /api/groups/mine` and shows group IDs and names.

### Saving a Group-Scoped Memory

1. Run `list-groups.sh` to find the group ID
2. Save with `--visibility group --permission-group-id <ID>`:

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks-handlers/save-memory.sh" \
  --tier "Operational" --category "Decision" --scope "backend" \
  --topic "Team-Only Convention" \
  --content "CONVENTION: Use feature flags for all new endpoints." \
  --visibility "group" --permission-group-id 42 \
  --working-dir "$PWD" --session-id "$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID"
```

The API validates that you are a member of the group. Non-members get a 403 error.

## How to Deactivate a Memory
When something is no longer true:
```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks-handlers/deactivate-memory.sh" 42
```
Do NOT delete memories. Deactivate them so there's a historical record.
