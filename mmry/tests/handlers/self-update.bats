# self-update.bats — Test plugin auto-update local-version fallback chain (#29966).
#
# These tests verify the *version-detection* refactor that prevents silent bails on
# legacy installs (~/.claude/mmry/ without a .claude-plugin/ subdirectory).
#
# Strategy: substitute curl with a deterministic mock that fails on the remote
# fetch. If the script reaches the curl call, we see the "failed to fetch" message
# on stderr — that proves version detection did NOT silently bail at step 1.
