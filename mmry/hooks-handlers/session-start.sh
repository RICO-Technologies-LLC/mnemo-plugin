# only when the script is invoked outside a hook context (e.g., manual tests).

    SETUP_MSG='MMRY AI is installed but needs to be set up. Run the setup script to authenticate via the browser.

## Setup

Run this command using the Bash tool:

bash ~/.claude/mmry/setup/mmry-setup.sh

This will open a browser window where the user can log in or create an account on mmryai.com. Once they authorize, the script writes the config file and permissions automatically.

If the browser does not open, the script prints a URL the user can copy and paste.

After setup completes, tell the user: "You are all set. Restart Claude Code and your memories will start loading automatically." Mention /mmry:help for a quick reference.

If the user does not have an account yet, direct them to https://mmryai.com to sign up first, then run setup again.'
